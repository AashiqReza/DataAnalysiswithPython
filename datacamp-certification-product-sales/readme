datacamp-certification-product-sales is part of Data Analyst Professional certification by Datacamp.

The certification process includes 4 stages:
  1. MCQ exam on fundamentals of statistics and SQL.
  2. MCQ exam on coding-related problems: mostly statistical analysis, data management, and plotting. (Technologies: R/Python)
  3. Project on analyzing product sales data provided by DataCamp. Details about the project will be found in the instructions. 
  4. Video recorded presentation on the findings of the analysis of product sales data.

In this repo, I am sharing the codes and presentation slides that I have used to excel in this certification exam.
